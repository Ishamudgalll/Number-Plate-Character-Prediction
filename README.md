INTRO
A vehicle registration plate is a metal or  plastic plate attached to a motor vehicle or  a trailer for Official Identification purposes.

The registration number is a numeric or  an alphanumeric code that uniquely  identifies the vehicle within the issuing  region’s database.

SO WHAT ARE WE TALKING  ABOUT ??
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a mass  surveillance method that uses Optical Character  Recognition on images to read the license plates on  vehicles.

ANPR Cameras are specialized types of CCTV camera  that has software built into it to help ID and capture  license plates on still and moving vehicles.

WHAT’S THE BASIS /  PREMISE ?
ANPR can be used to store the images  captured by the cameras as well as the text  from the license plate, with some configurable  to store a photograph of the driver.

Systems commonly use InfraRed (IR) lighting  to allow the camera to take the picture at any  time of the day. ANPR technology tends to be  region-specific, owing to plate variation from  place to place.

SO WHERE IS IT USED ?

ANPR systems are here to stay – from  Parking and Motorway Tolling to Border  Control and Journey Time Enforcement

The most predominantly prevalent usage  of ANPR, today, is in Electronic Toll  Collection systems (ETC) / Intelligent  Traffic Management Systems.
